# BlackJack Digital Program
The Black Jack Program is a collaborative software engineering project developed as part of the CS360 course at Western Connecticut State University. Its primary goal is to give players a real life experience of playing BlackJack without having to rely on human dealers at the casino, reduce costs, error and all from the comfort of their own home.
